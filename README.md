# AI-Deadlift-Judge
Uses a pose estimation model that extracts key points from each frame, capturing movement. This data is fed into a custom-designed TCN before outputting predictions for three distinct infraction cards as defined by the IPF.

Made this project for my Final Year University Project, feel free to take a look or use it if you'd like.

Run the DLJudgeApp.py for UI and inference.

Read the PDF_DLJudge_Report.pdf for implementation details.
